# tiktok-download-without-watermark
I assume anyone looking at this has some background in python

1. After cloning repository create a python virtual environment using ```virtualenv venv```
2. Then run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Then run the file using ```python video_download.py``` or ```python3 video_download.py```

*for your local systems you can change where the file will be saved

*Key takeaway, this is not an automation to scrape videos rather a way to download tiktoks through 'https://ssstik.io/en' through creating a post request
and parsing the response so that it can be saved on your local drive
